						A passionate and innovative problem solver with a solid foundation in software and mechanical engineering, complemented by extensive experience in data management, system integration, user interface design, and machine learning. My academic journey culminated in a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I led award-winning projects. Professionally, I have a proven track record as a software engineer and architect at FLIR Systems, Inc., where I developed cutting-edge software systems to enhance production efficiency and accuracy in thermal camera manufacturing. My work spans from developing deep learning models for defect detection to creating automated systems for neuroscience research, significantly boosting productivity and research capabilities. I am committed to leveraging my technical expertise to tackle impactful challenges and create meaningful solutions.

					As part of the Manufacturing Test and Automation team at FLIR, I spearheaded the development of an innovative machine learning algorithm designed to identify "blob" type defects within the manufacturing stages of thermal focal plane arrays (FPAs). Traditional detection techniques were proficient at identifying common defects like scratches, noisy arrays, or shorted/open pixels, but the challenge of detecting blob defects remained largely unsolved, leading to a reliance on manual inspection methods that were both time-consuming and inconsistent.
					<br>
					<br>
					To tackle this issue, I initiated a project that leveraged a deep learning framework to autonomously recognize blob-type anomalies in FPAs. This solution was developed by training a model on the existing dataset of human-annotated images. The implementation of this model marked a significant technological advancement, achieving an impressive detection accuracy of approximately 95%. This breakthrough not only enhanced the efficiency of the manufacturing process by early identification and removal of defective FPAs but also generated considerable cost savings by preventing these units from advancing to more costly stages of production.

					During my time at FLIR, I contributed significantly to the development of critical sensor technology for the Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) system, a cornerstone of the United States' defense against Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs). THAAD is a system designed to intercept incoming ballistic missiles, including nuclear threats, during their terminal phase of their approach to impact. FLIR's cryogenically cooled mid-wavelength IR sensors are pivotal for the THAAD system's ability to detect and track incoming threats, ensuring a robust defense mechanism.
					<br>
					<br>
					I acted as the primary software developer for the final Quality Assurance (QA) testing of THAAD sensors. This involved intricate software engineering to interface with complex electromechanical systems for data collection and analysis.
					<br>
					Our software served as FLIR's final validation step for the sensors, necessitating adherence to stringent standards for repeatability and measurement accuracy. I successfully navigated extensive third-party validation processes to guarantee sensor reliability in critical scenarios.
					<br>
					<br>
					While my career at FLIR involved contributing to defense technology, I am deeply committed to ethical principles and the pursuit of work that serves constructive purposes. I recognize the importance of defense systems in maintaining peace and security, and I am proud of my contributions to THAAD. However, moving forward, my focus is to leverage my expertise in technology and leadership towards projects that directly contribute to constructive, rather than destructive, efforts.

					In the Dr. Goard Research Lab, training mice to play video games was a critical yet slow and costly process, heavily reliant on human supervision. Identifying the need for innovation, I led a team of undergraduate engineers to develop a groundbreaking automated training device, tackling this challenge head-on. Our multidisciplinary approach resulted in a system that not only automated the training process but did so in a way that was engaging for mice, safe, reliable, and cost-effective. Key to our success was creating a user-friendly interface that allowed lab technicians without engineering backgrounds to easily maintain the system.
					<br><br>
					This project significantly advanced the lab's research capabilities by slashing training times by up to 80% and increasing our training capacity sixfold, thereby resolving the critical bottleneck of producing sufficiently trained mice for complex neuroscience experiments.
					<br><br>
					The impact of our work extends beyond just numbers; it has opened new avenues for research, leading to developments in the mapping of the visual cortex, and insights into how memories are formed.
					<br><br>
					We engineered a generalized game engine for similar projects, enabling the development of similar research games with high efficiency.

					To ensure seamless hardware integration and minimize response times, we also developed specialized Arduino firmware. This firmware transforms the Arduino Uno into an efficient, low-latency I/O device, crucial for our experiments' real-time demands.

						In June 2017, I embarked on developing a real-time online MOBA-like game, Wildy. As a solo developer, I navigated the complexities of game development including architecture, 3D animation, GPU computing, and networking. Wildy presented the unique challenge of synchronizing game-state across multiple clients, leading me to tackle intricate distributed systems and consensus issues. These challenges honed my computing and software engineering skills significantly.
						<br>
						<br>
						I successfully brought the game to a playable state, conducting public playtests that engaged numerous players. Feedback from these tests was invaluable, although it also highlighted limitations due to early architectural decisions. Recognizing these limitations, I made the decision to pause development. However, the experience was far from a setback. The insights gained have propelled me to several professional achievements, enriching my approach to software design and project management. I continue to apply these lessons to current projects, always with an eye towards software best-practices and scalable architecture.

				<b>High Precision Pan-Tilt System for FLIR Cameras</b>
				<br>
				As part of my Capstone project at the University of California, Santa Barbara, I collaborated with a talented team of engineers to explore a new potential drivetrain architecture for FLIR's pan-tilt lineup: Harmonic DriveÂ®. This drivetrain technology eliminated the backlash that limited previous worm-drive systems, and aimed to bring unprecedented accuracy and repeatability into pan-tilt systems capable of seamless integration with FLIRâ€™s thermal imaging cameras. This endeavor aimed not only to enhance the operational efficiency of FLIRâ€™s imaging solutions but also to push the boundaries of high-zoom automated security monitoring systems.

					This video showcases the meticulous design process and the collaborative effort that went into building the pan-tilt system. It begins with an exploded view of the CAD model, highlighting the complex assembly of components, each designed with precision and durability in mind. Pay particular attention to the rotary seal assemblies, motor mounts, camera mounting system, and waterproofing (which successfully passed IP67 standards). These were my primary mechanical contributions to this project. These components are crucial for ensuring the system's high performance and reliability under varied environmental conditions.
