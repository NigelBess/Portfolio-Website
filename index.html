					Experiments at the Dr. Goard Research lab involve imaging the brains of mice while they play simple video games. I joined the lab as a systems engineer and led a small team of undergraduate engineers to develop an automated device for training mice to play those games. We designed everything including hardware, software, electronics, robotics control, and data collection in a high-reliability and low-cost package capable of running 24 hours a day for months on end without human supervision.
					<br><br>
					The system yielded mice with higher in-game performance and reduced training times by as much as 80 percent. It also proved to be extremely scalable and led to a 600 percent increase in training capacity. These metrics were incredibly valuable to the lab, whose limiting factor in research was often their supply of trained mice.

						In June 2017 I began working on a realtime online MOBA-like game, called Wildy. The project has been a tremendous undertaking, as beyond requiring the basics of game development (architecture, 3D animation, GPU computing, etc), Wildy posed the additional challenge of maintaining a consistent game-state across multiple clients. This leadsto some complicated distributed systems and consensus problems which taught me many lessons in computing and software engineering.

						I was able to bring the game to a playable state and had a couple successful online play tests, but in the end, poor architecture choices led to an unmaintanable mess which would be excessively time-consuming to work on. While the game was never fully released it has taught me many lessons that have led to successes in multiple large-scale projects in the professional world.

					For my Capstone project at UCSB, I was part of a team that designed and built a high precision, high reliability pan-tilt system for FLIR. My biggest contributions to the project were the design of the rotary seal assemblies, design of the camera mounting system, drivetrain selection, and writing the firmware.
